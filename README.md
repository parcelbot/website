# ParcelBot's Website
This is the github repo hosting our website (using [github pages](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/getting-started-with-github-pages/about-github-pages)), code is open-source and free to use!

## What's on the website?
For now, this website is mostly a static webpage, here to present what you can do with our bot.

It's also there to show you the existing functionnality, the limitations of the bot, etc.

It also serves the purpose of a landing page, to let people invite the bot, and/or just discover the bot.

## What are the plans for the future?
For now ParcelBot is our only project, but we intend to create multiple small bots that would be super cool to use and replace your everyday boring, sometimes expensive, apps.

***Could we get a sneak peak on the next project?*<br>**
Yes! Our next project is going to be about images, (not another ai generating image bot) but something about posting images in Discord.

## Our hope for this project
Is that you will like this project, and use it as much as possible. Be sure to give us feedback on the bot, by submitting your opinion on the website [page](https://parcelbot.xyz/feedback).

## We want and need your help
If you wish to add functiunalities, whether it's on the website or on the bot, be sure to make a pull requests with your changes. And we will make sure to check it out.
<br><br>We are also planning on adding a localization system on the bot. And that would be super cool if everyone could participate.
